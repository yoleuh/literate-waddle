good practice with lists and pointers

i had some trouble with the pointers in insertNode and createNode. i was passing a single pointer to head instead of two like in the
arguments. when using using gdb i saw that when i was passing in the wrong type of pointers i was getting a segmentation fault and
exiting immediately. i tried with a few different type of pointers and finally i found the right one that gave back the right vaules.
i set breakpoints at main, insertNode, and read, i would run step by step in read untill it hit insertNode and then i saw that was
where the error was.
